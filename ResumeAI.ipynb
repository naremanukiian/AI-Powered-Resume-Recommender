        "This project creates an AI-powered resume recommendation system using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, Streamlit for the user interface, and ngrok for exposing the app to the internet. Users can paste their resume and a job description into the app to receive tailored recommendations. The system analyzes the input and generates suggestions for resume improvements, matching skills, and the best type of resume for the job. The project demonstrates a seamless integration of AI, interactive web interfaces, and cloud tunneling services to make the tool accessible online. The app is hosted locally using Streamlit, and ngrok is used to create a public URL, making the app available to anyone via the internet."

        "In this section, the core logic of the AI-powered resume recommendation system is implemented. The code uses streamlit to create a user interface that allows the user to input their resume/profile and job description. It also integrates OpenAI's API to generate a tailored resume recommendation based on the input. The OpenAI client is initialized with the provided API key, and a button is created to trigger the recommendation generation. The system formulates a prompt for OpenAI's GPT model to analyze the inputs and provide insights such as resume type, matching skills, improvement suggestions, and a detailed explanation. The st.spinner shows a loading indicator while the API processes the request, and any errors are handled with exception handling to ensure smooth user experience."
